# UnrealFileDialog
A simple plugin for a runtime file dialog made with UMG. It is entirely written in C++ while offering full blueprint compatibility.

## What it offers

A file dialog widget that supports three modes:
- Open file
- Open directory
- Save file

Thanks to the CommonUI plugin, it is easily stylable via Blueprints.
There is also an async blueprint node for easier callback handling.
